When is recursion less efficient than iteration?
Recursion can be less efficient than iteration due to:

Stack Overflow: Recursion uses the call stack, which can overflow if the recursion depth is too large.
Performance: Each recursive call has its own overhead due to function calls, which can lead to slower performance.
Example:
When calculating the factorial of a large number using recursion, deep recursion can cause a stack overflow or performance degradation due to repeated function calls.

Iterative is better for large numbers

When to prefer iteration:

For large datasets or deep recursion: Iteration is often preferred because it doesnâ€™t use the call stack and is typically faster.
